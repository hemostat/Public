Recent analyses of biobank-scale genetic data suggest: (i) inclusion of genetically related individuals empowers GWAS (Loh et al. 2018); (ii) the wealth of collected environmental exposures has potential to uncover gene-by-environmental interactions (Young, Wauthier, and Donnelly 2016). However, quantification of GWAS power — the non-centrality parameter (\\(NCP\\)) of association test, which is proportional to the sample size (\\(n\\)) and the variance explained by genetic variant (\\(q^2\\)) — holds only for unrelated individuals. Here, we first expanded it by incorporating individual relationships by linear mixed model. We next studied gene-by-environment interactions, where interaction effect on trait is tested in the presence of marginal genetic effect. In result, the derived formulas have a range of implications. For testing marginal genetic effect, one can quickly assess the power in studies involving related individuals. Because of the potential gain in power for testing gene-by-environment interaction, the formula for interactions will allow optimization of the study design of related individuals. 1.1 Introduction 1.2 Methods and Analytical Derivations 1.2.1 Linear mixed model for genetic association study \\[\\begin{equation} y \\sim \\mathcal{N} (\\mu x_0 + \\beta_g x_g, \\sum{\\sigma_i^2 R_i} + \\sigma_r^2 I) \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] We showed in Section 2.3 that \\(var(\\hat{\\beta}_g) = (x_g^T \\hat{V}^{-1} x_g)^{-1}\\), where \\(\\hat{V} = \\sum{\\hat{\\sigma}_i^2 R_i} + \\hat{\\sigma}_r^2 I\\). We further consider \\(x_g\\) as a realization of a random (vector) variable \\(\\mathcal{X}_g\\) with mean-vector of zeros and covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma_g = 2 p (1 - p) K\\), where \\(p\\) is the minor allele frequency of the genotype and \\(K\\) is the kinship matrix in the general case. As outlined in Section 2.2, the following quadratic form \\(\\mathcal{X}_g^T A \\mathcal{X}_g\\) is a scalar random variable given a transformation matrix \\(A = \\hat{V}^{-1}\\), and its mean is equal to \\(E(\\mathcal{X}_g^T A \\mathcal{X}_g) = tr(A \\Sigma_g)\\). Hence, that gives us the final expression \\(var(\\hat{\\beta}_g) \\approx (E(\\mathcal{X}_g^T \\hat{V}^{-1} \\mathcal{X}_g))^{-1} = tr(\\hat{V}^{-1} \\Sigma_g)^{-1}\\). 1.2.2 Testing marginal genetic effect Consider a set of related individuals, which relatedness is expressed by the kinship matrix (\\(K\\)), and association between outcome (\\(y\\)) and genotype (\\(g\\)) is evaluated by linear mixed model. For a given phenotypic variance-covariance matrix (\\(V\\)), we show that the non-centrality parameter for marginal association test can be approximated as following: \\[\\begin{equation} NCP = \\hat{\\beta}_g^2 / var(\\hat{\\beta}_g) \\approx \\hat{\\beta}_g^2 tr( \\hat{V}^{-1} \\Sigma_g) \\tag{1.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(tr\\) is the trace operator and \\(\\Sigma_g\\) is the covariance matrix of genotypes. For families we have \\(V = \\sigma_k^2 K + \\sigma_r^2 I\\) and \\(\\Sigma_g = \\sigma_g^2 K\\), that results in following: \\[\\begin{equation} NCP_{fam} = q^2 tr( (\\sigma_k^2 K + \\sigma_r^2 I)^{-1} K ) \\tag{1.3} \\end{equation}\\] That means \\(NCP_{rel} \\leq NCP\\), i.e. for the same sample size, power is expected to decrease as relatedness between individuals increases — which was previously shown analytically only for sib-pairs in (Visscher et al., 2008). 1.2.3 Testing gene-environment interaction effect Further, we consider testing for fixed effect gene-by-environment interaction in related individuals. We have derived NCPrel+int=tr(V-1Σint), where Σint is the covariance matrix in distribution of the interaction variable. For families we have V= [h2K+I], Σint=q2w2Kint, where w2=f(1–f) and f is the frequency of binary exposure. Kint is a matrix derived from K and depends on realization of exposure in a given study. We argue that Kint is different from the matrix recently proposed in (Sul et al., 2016). We validated all results by simulations. \\[\\begin{equation} NCP_{rel+int} = \\beta_{int}^2 tr( \\hat{V}^{-1} \\Sigma_{int}) \\tag{1.4} \\end{equation}\\] 1.3 Results 1.3.1 Analytical results for testing marginal genetic effect Table 1.1: Analytical comparison of study designs to detect marginal genetic association. Study designs differ in individual relationships that shape modeling of outcome (\\(y\\)) and distribution of genotype under association test (\\(x_g\\)). The statistical power to detect an association depends on the non-centrality parameter \\(NCP = \\hat{\\beta}_g^2 / var(\\hat{\\beta}_g)\\) and, thus, the formula for variance of \\(\\hat{\\beta}_g\\) is reported for each study. Study designs under comparison include: unrelated individuals; unrelated individuals with a non-genetic grouping factor such as medical centers; unrelated individuals with modeling outcome conditioned on genetic effects using Genetic Relationship Matrix (GRM); related individuals in families.
