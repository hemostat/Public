Recent analyses of biobank-scale genetic data suggest: (i) inclusion of genetically related individuals empowers GWAS (Loh et al. 2018); (ii) the wealth of collected environmental exposures has potential to uncover gene-by-environmental interactions (Young, Wauthier, and Donnelly 2016). However, quantification of GWAS power —  the non-centrality parameter (\\(NCP\\)) of association test, which is proportional to the sample size (\\(n\\)) and the variance explained by genetic variant (\\(q^2\\)) —  holds only for unrelated individuals. Here, we first expanded it by incorporating individual relationships by linear mixed model. We next studied gene-by-environment interactions, where interaction effect on trait is tested in the presence of marginal genetic effect. In result, the derived formulas have a range of implications. For testing marginal genetic effect, one can quickly assess the power in studies involving related individuals. Because of the potential gain in power for testing gene-by-environment interaction, the formula for interactions will allow optimization of the study design of related individuals. 1.1 Methods and Analytical Derivations 1.1.1 Association model \\[\\begin{equation} y \\sim (X \\beta, V) = (\\mu + \\beta_x x, \\sum{\\sigma_i^2 R_i} + \\sigma_r^2 I) \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] 1.1.2 Testing marginal genetic effect Consider a set of related individuals, which relatedness is expressed by the kinship matrix (\\(K\\)),  and association between outcome (\\(y\\)) and genotype (\\(g\\)) is evaluated by linear mixed model. For a given phenotypic variance-covariance matrix (\\(V\\)), we show that the non-centrality parameter for marginal association test can be approximated as following: \\[\\begin{equation} NCP = \\hat{\\beta}_g^2 / var(\\hat{\\beta}_g) \\approx \\hat{\\beta}_g^2 tr( \\hat{V}^{-1} \\Sigma_g) \\tag{1.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(tr\\) is the trace operator and \\(\\Sigma_g\\) is the covariance matrix of genotypes. For families we have \\(V = \\sigma_k^2 K + \\sigma_r^2 I\\) and \\(\\Sigma_g = \\sigma_g^2 K\\), that results in following: \\[\\begin{equation} NCP_{fam} = q^2 tr( (\\sigma_k^2 K + \\sigma_r^2 I)^{-1} K ) \\tag{1.3} \\end{equation}\\] That means \\(NCP_{rel} \\leq NCP\\), i.e. for the same sample size, power is expected to decrease as relatedness between individuals increases — which was previously shown analytically only for sib-pairs in (Visscher et al., 2008). 1.1.3 Testing gene-environment interaction effect Further, we consider testing for fixed effect gene-by-environment interaction in related individuals. We have derived NCPrel+int=tr(V-1Σint), where Σint is the covariance matrix in distribution of the interaction variable. For families we have V= [h2K+I], Σint=q2w2Kint, where w2=f(1–f) and f is the frequency of binary exposure. Kint is a matrix derived from K and depends on realization of exposure in a given study. We argue that Kint is different from the matrix recently proposed in (Sul et al., 2016). We validated all results by simulations. \\[\\begin{equation} NCP_{rel+int} = \\beta_{int}^2 tr( \\hat{V}^{-1} \\Sigma_{int}) \\tag{1.4} \\end{equation}\\] 1.2 Results 1.2.1 Summary on analytical results Table 1.1: Comparison of study designs to detect marginal genetic association.

The statistical power to detect an association depends on the non-centrality parameter \\(NCP = \\hat{\\beta}_g^2 / var(\\hat{\\beta}_g)\\) and, thus, the formula for variance of \\(\\hat{\\beta}_g\\) is reported for each study. Study designs under comparison include: unrelated individuals; unrelated individuals with a non-genetic grouping factor such as medical centers; unrelated individuals with modeling outcome conditioned on genetic effects using Genetic Relationship Matrix (GRM); related individuals in families. 1.2.2 Implication in association studies References "],
